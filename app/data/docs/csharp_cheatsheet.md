# C# Quick Reference

C# is a modern, statically typed, object-oriented programming language. It is widely used for enterprise applications, game development via Unity, and backend systems with .NET Core. Its syntax blends Java and C++ influences but with enhanced safety and tooling.

C# enforces type safety while supporting inference with `var`. It provides generics, async/await for concurrency, and LINQ for expressive queries. Collections include arrays, lists, and dictionaries. Strong typing makes refactoring easier and reduces runtime errors.

Object-oriented principles are central: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes can define auto-implemented properties, methods, and events. Structs provide lightweight value types.

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) allows SQL-like operations on collections. Example: `var evens = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);`. Combined with async streams, this enables scalable data pipelines.

C# is powerful for large-scale systems where maintainability, performance, and integration with Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem are key.
