# Python Quick Reference

Python is a versatile programming language emphasizing readability and simplicity. It supports multiple paradigms including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. Its clean syntax makes it beginner friendly while offering advanced capabilities.

Data structures include lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Lists are ordered and mutable, dictionaries hold key-value pairs, sets enforce uniqueness, and tuples are immutable sequences. Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection simplify memory management.

Control flow relies on indentation. Loops, if/else, and comprehensions allow expressive logic. Functions are defined with `def` and support default arguments, *args, and **kwargs. Classes provide object-oriented structure with methods and inheritance.

Popular libraries expand functionality: NumPy for arrays, pandas for data analysis, FastAPI for web APIs, and LangChain for AI workflows. Python is widely used in data science, machine learning, and backend development, making it one of the most important languages to learn.
