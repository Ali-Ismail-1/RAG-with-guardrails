# System Design Principles

System design involves structuring complex software systems for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It balances trade-offs between performance, cost, and complexity.

Scalability strategies include vertical scaling (bigger machines) and horizontal scaling (more machines). Load balancers distribute traffic, while caching reduces repeated computation. Databases play a critical role: relational databases ensure consistency, while NoSQL systems provide flexibility and speed. Vector databases enable similarity search for AI.

Reliability comes from redundancy, replication, and failover strategies. Monitoring, logging, and observability ensure issues are detected early. CAP theorem reminds us that distributed systems can guarantee at most two of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

Designing a system begins with requirements gathering, then defining APIs, choosing storage, and mapping components. Key bottlenecks must be anticipated. Resilient design emphasizes modularity, security, and testability. Good system design evolves with changing scale and requirements.
