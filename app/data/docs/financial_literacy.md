# Financial Literacy Basics

Financial literacy is the ability to understand and manage personal finances effectively. It involves budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management. One of the most powerful concepts is compound interest: money invested grows exponentially over time. A simple budget rule is the 50/30/20 plan: 50% of income for needs, 30% for wants, 20% for savings or debt repayment.

Credit management is equally important. Factors such as payment history, credit utilization, and account age impact your credit score. High-interest debt, like credit cards, drains wealth rapidly and should be minimized.

Investing focuses on risk and reward. Stocks offer high growth potential, bonds provide stability, and index funds balance risk through diversification. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs offer tax advantages. Building an emergency fund adds resilience.

Financial literacy is not only about wealth accumulation but also about financial security and freedom. Protecting assets through insurance and planning ensures long-term stability.
